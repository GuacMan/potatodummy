  <h2><strong>Why I'm Sorry?</strong></h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li><strong>IT was my own jealousy issues</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Raiha wallah im sorry for letting my emotions get to my head</li>
      <li>i made you feel as you couldnt even tell me about something which you were extremely excited about</li>
      <li>this is my own issue which i shouldve dealt with and i shouldnt have unnecesarily ruined your mood because you didnt deserve it, you were just happy</li>
      <li>you have every right to be pissed at mebecause i had no place forcing my feelings onto you for no reason</li>
      <li>raiha i even said back then and i mean it raiha, wallahi you can like anyone thats your choice thats your feelings </li>
      <li>as i have feelings ik how much they mean to a person so wallah raiha i wouldve never said no you cant, i genuinely fully support you on this raiha.</li>
      <li>infact im extremely happy for you, wallah!</li>
      <li>wallah i mean it from the heart i want you to go for it and try becoming close</li>
      <li>you are a person who never does feelings thats why i wanna push you to do it because its your first time and man im excited for you.</li>
      <li>and raiha yes sure i may have feelings but i meant what i said, our friendship you being happy matters 100000000 times more to me, more than anything at all.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Again my fault for a bad miscommunication.</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Raiha wallah right from the first vm and message i supported you fully,</li>
      <li>yes i was acting extremely off but im sorry i just needed some time to process the info, wallah i was never against it i just needed a bit of time.</li>
      <li>raiha i tried saying it in every vm because wallah i meant it and i didnt want you to think otherwise but i clearlyt didnt say it properly and as you said made it about myself</li>
      <li>which is fucked up and im extremely sorry!</li>
      <li>Raiha i swear to Allah like from the bottom of my heart, from the very first vm i genuinely meant what i said</li>
      <li>i am happy for you raiha, i really really am</li>
      <li>again me wanting some time was mo excuse for putting so much shit on you it was my issue which i myself shouldve delt with.</li>
      <li>but i want to reiterate it again raiha wallah from the first vm i have been happy for you, and i'll be extremely happy to support you and help you all the way through</li>
      <li>cause honestly this all this is exciting and i want to see it through what ends up happening with you, as your friend</li>
      <li>no no sorry, YOUR WINGMAN!!!</li>
      <li>All i wish and care and pray for is that our relationship because of what i did or anything that happens in the future doesnt get ruined because honestlty more than anything that and you being happy solely is the most important thing to me,</li>
      <li>and i promise i will never have such  wierd emotional outburst like that and i promise i'll never make you feel like that again,</li>
      <li>it shouve never happened in the first place but im sorry it did and im an absolutely terrible friend for doing so, if you allow me, i want to make ammends and  make it upto you.</li>
      <li>So i promise you raiha you can talk to me about it wallah i genuinely want to hear more, its honestly interesting and funny cause THIS THE FIRST TIME THE RAIHA AMIR KHAN has feelings </li>
      <li>NAH NAH THATS SO MAD LIKE HOW ON GODS GREEN EARTH CAN I EVER MISS THAT</li>
      <li>wallah raiha i would love to hear you talk about it more and help and support you as much as i can!!</li>
